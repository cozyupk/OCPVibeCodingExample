# I Want to Ride Out Life with the New Concept of OCP Vibe Coding (LOL)

📖 This article is also available in Japanese: [日本語バージョンはこちら](https://qiita.com/cozyupk/items/0334ce221d0dddce7023)

I’m diligently programming every day while keeping the **SOLID principles** in mind.  
But when I read **vibe coding articles** on the Internet, I sometimes think:

> “Wait, am I just some old guy indulging in a traditional craft in the age of generative AI?  
> It feels like training in Morse code right before the Internet takes over…”

Those thoughts occasionally pop into my head.

Generative AI, SOLID… SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP… hold up. **Maybe the key to vibe coding in the generative‑AI era is hidden in SOLID.** Rather than “let AI write the code first and then humans abstract it,” perhaps the proper way is **“humans write the abstraction layer and then let AI implement the details.”** If so, there’s a chance I can survive as one of those **rare humans who can make AI write high‑quality code**.

With that in mind, I decided to try a **minimal example**: after designing with **OCP (Open/Closed Principle) in mind**, could I get an AI to write source code of reasonable quality? This is just at the “Hello, World” level.

## Review

### What is Vibe Coding?

The term **“vibe coding”** is often said to have been sparked by an offhand tweet from Andrej Karpathy (whether that’s historically accurate is another matter, but it’s often mentioned as a meme in the generative‑AI world).

What Karpathy described is a development style where **humans and AI alternately add to the code like a “vibration” (vibe).** Humans design the skeleton and abstractions, and AI rapidly adds flesh to it. Then humans refactor or tweak the design, and AI generates code again. This back‑and‑forth cycle is repeated.

If traditional “pair programming” is based on conversations between humans, vibe coding is a style where **human design thinking and AI generative ability alternate and shake each other.** Put another way, it naturally realizes a tag‑team of “humans handle the design, AI handles the implementation,” which is a development style unique to the generative‑AI era.

Incidentally, the general public tends to think of it as, **“If you leave it to AI, it’ll take care of everything, right? There’s no need for programmers anymore. Who cares about SOLID these days?”** (That’s just my bias, lol.) In that context, people often talk about **“humans do the requirements definition, AI does the design and implementation, and then humans do the final review.”** (Again, personal impressions.)

### OCP: The Open/Closed Principle

OCP (Open/Closed Principle) is the “O” in SOLID. Summed up in a phrase, it’s the guideline that **“software should be open to extension and closed to modification.”**

In other words, when you want to add new features or behaviors, the ideal is to insert them through extension points (abstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism, etc.) without directly touching the existing code.

By following this principle you can add features without breaking existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs. Especially for large systems and products with long lifespans, clearly separating **“the closed foundation”** from **“the open extension parts”** is key to maintainability.

Perhaps an intuitive metaphor would be a **potted plant.** The pot is closed on all sides except the top, so it functions as a pot—you can carry it by hand or display it on a windowsill or in a garden (its specification is fixed). You can also tap it gently to make sure it hasn’t cracked (tests). Yet the top is open, so you can **put something in it and do something with it** (i.e., implementations and extensions). Typically you put soil in and grow a plant.

As the Wikipedia article on the Open/Closed Principle notes, two interpretations have coexisted historically. Roughly speaking in modern terms:

*   **Meyer’s Open/Closed Principle (1988)** — an approach where you **extend via inheritance or redefining** without modifying existing code. For example, frameworks that assume inheritance (Template Method / Hook) and encourage you to “inherit this base class and use it.”
    
*   **Martin’s Open/Closed Principle (1990s)** — Uncle Bob from _Clean Architecture_. You extend through **abstractions (interfaces/abstract classes) and polymorphism** while keeping existing code closed. For example, frameworks that inject **components implementing a certain interface** via DI/factories/arguments. (The acronym SOLID was named by Michael Feathers, and Uncle Bob greatly popularized this interpretation.)
    

From my practical perspective, **Martin’s “abstract replacement” style** works well with modern DI/configuration management and tends to preserve readability and testability. On the other hand, at a small scope, **Meyer‑style inheritance** can be the quickest and simplest, so a mix‑and‑match approach is often good. (There’s a certain OOP romance to the inheritance OCP, lol.)


Let’s Experiment
----------------

### Concept

For this experiment I’ll use **C#**, a language I’ve been using a lot lately.

With a pure “Hello, World!” program it’s hard to feel the effect of OCP. At best you’d be swapping out the message or the output destination.

So this time I’ll try making a **simple date‑time simulator based on the proleptic Gregorian calendar that starts on January 1 in the year 1.** Starting at **00:00 on 1 January 0001**, it increments time in **one‑second steps** and outputs the result as **a string in seconds**—that’s the idea.

### Preparation

From here I’ll actually prepare a [C# project](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/tree/main/src/HumanAuthored). I’ll create a new console app and set up the minimal class structure.

First are the [abstractions](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/tree/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions).

In [CalendarUnitBase.cs](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs) I create a **common base class for the classes that hold the “number” of each unit (year, month, …, second).** This class implements properties such as [`Start`/`End`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs#L11-L12) to hold **the “starting number” and “ending number” for that unit**, and also stores references to **the instance of the next unit and the previous unit** via [`PrevUnit`/`NextUnit`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs#L7-L9). The allowed operations are [`Increment()`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs#L14) to **add one unit**, [`AsString()`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs#L16) to **obtain a string representation**, and [`SetEnd()`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs#L18) to handle cases where, for example, **the last day of the month varies by month**. To limit operations on lower and higher units, we also define interfaces like [`IPrevUnit`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0110_IPrevUnit.cs) and [`INextUnit`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0120_INextUnit.cs) and [use them](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0100_Abstractions/0130_CalendarUnitBase.cs#L7-L9).

Next I implement the [“seconds” unit](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0200_CalendarUnits/0210_SecondsUnit.cs) and the [“minutes” unit](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/0200_CalendarUnits/0220_MinutesUnit.cs) as references.

Because I’m lazy In order to focus on the effect of OCP, I won’t write any comments.

After writing [an entry point](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/HumanAuthored/Program.cs) to test it roughly, here’s a sample run (click to expand but it’s nothing special):

```
After 27,629 seconds: 40:29
After 54,282 seconds: 45:12
After 30,124 seconds: 07:17
[output truncated]
After 92,271 seconds: 58:55
After 40,577 seconds: 15:13
After 70,334 seconds: 47:28
Final time: 47:29
```

### The Generative Guy

Now it’s time to bring in **“our company’s (a one‑person shop) junior programmer: GPT.”**

### ChatGPT (GPT‑5)

It did it—and even **extended the code up to “Gregorian year (YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:mm:ss).”** Here’s a rough summary of what GPT did:

*   Starting from the existing chain of `SecondsUnit` (seconds) → `MinuteUnit` (minutes), it added higher‑order units so that time → date → year are connected.
    
    *   Added: `HourUnit` (hours, 0–23) / `DayUnit` (days, 1–28/29/30/31) / `MonthUnit` (months, 1–12) / `YearUnit` (years, 0001–9999)
        
*   Implemented overflow cascading at every layer. For example, when seconds go from 59→0 it calls `Increment()` on minutes; when minutes go from 59→0 it increments hours; and so on up to years.
    
*   Implemented a mechanism in `MonthUnit` to dynamically update the upper bound of `DayUnit` using `IPrevUnit.SetEnd(daysInMonth)`. Leap years are determined by the Gregorian rule (400/100/4), so February automatically switches between 29 and 28 days.
    
*   Overrode string representations in each unit and concatenated them:
    
    *   `YearUnit` → `"YYYY"`
        
    *   `MonthUnit` → `Next + "-MM"`
        
    *   `DayUnit` → `Next + "-DD"`
        
    *   `HourUnit` → `Next + " HH"`
        
    *   `MinuteUnit`/`SecondsUnit` → `Next + ":mm"` / `Next + ":ss"`
        
*   Modified the existing `MinuteUnit` so that it properly carries over from minutes to hours, not just seconds to minutes. It sets `NextUnit = new HourUnit(this);`.
    

**How to use it**

As before, just create `new SecondsUnit()` and call `Increment()`. The `AsString()` method returns a string in the format `"YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:mm:ss"` (initially `0001‑01‑01 00:00:00`).

**Added files**

*   `0200_CalendarUnits/0230_HourUnit.cs`
    
*   `0200_CalendarUnits/0240_DayUnit.cs`
    
*   `0200_CalendarUnits/0250_MonthUnit.cs`
    
*   `0200_CalendarUnits/0260_YearUnit.cs`
    

**Updated files**

*   `0200_CalendarUnits/0220_MinutesUnit.cs`
    
    *   Fixed carry‑over to call `NextUnit?.Increment()`
        
    *   Set `NextUnit = new HourUnit(this);`
        

If needed, it would be possible to add conversion between the Japanese era names (Reiwa/Heisei, etc.) and Gregorian years, time‑zone/UTC switching, separating `DateOnly` / `TimeOnly`, and so on, within this structure. Shall we do that? 😎

Here’s a sample run (again, nothing fancy):

```
After 30,705 seconds: 0001-01-01 08:31:45
After 90,223 seconds: 0001-01-02 09:35:29
After 22,043 seconds: 0001-01-02 15:42:53
[output truncated]
After 28,775 seconds: 0002-10-23 23:11:52
After 12,912 seconds: 0002-10-24 02:47:05
After 15,836 seconds: 0002-10-24 07:11:02
Final time: 0002-10-24 07:11:03
```

### A Self‑Proclaimed Review Boss Reviews It

So, I reviewed the [code generated by our junior programmer](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/tree/main/src/VibeCoded) (even though I usually get reviewed by GPT, lol).

**Overall it’s wonderfully done.** It even follows **my personal rule of putting numbers at the beginning of file names to control display order in VS (Visual Studio)**, and it implemented each “unit” as intended. The part where it [sets the last day of each month](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0250_MonthUnit.cs#L19-L37) via `SetEnd()` matches my intentions, and it even correctly implemented the [leap‑year check](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0250_MonthUnit.cs#L29) (years divisible by 4 are leap years, but years divisible by 100 are not, except that years divisible by 400 are again leap years), which is what most first‑year computer science students would write in their report.

**Probably due to issues in my prompt, there were two points I noticed.**

First, in the [implementation of `YearUnit`, it made the `Value` public even though I intended it to be private to uphold encapsulation](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0260_YearUnit.cs#L14). However, since my base implementation didn’t anticipate that “the upper layer (month) needs to refer to the lower layer (year) in order to compute the last day of February,” there wasn’t much choice; it had to do that.

The other point is more “it didn’t fix my sloppy code” than anything else: each unit’s `Increment()` was essentially the same, but it didn’t push the common logic up into the base class.

*   [`SecondsUnit.cs`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0210_SecondsUnit.cs#L12-L20)
    
*   [`MinutesUnit.cs`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0220_MinutesUnit.cs#L13-L21)
    
*   [`HourUnit.cs`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0230_HourUnit.cs#L15-L23)
    
*   [`DayUnit.cs`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0240_DayUnit.cs#L15-L23)
    
*   [`MonthUnit.cs`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0250_MonthUnit.cs#L39-L48)
    
*   [`YearUnit.cs`](https://github.com/cozyupk/OCPVibeCodingExample/blob/main/src/VibeCoded/0200_CalendarUnits/0260_YearUnit.cs#L16-L23)
    

Both of these issues could probably be solved by inserting a “review our code before asking it to extend the code” phase. The rest can be handled via the prompt. Maybe a prompt like the following would work—according to GPT.

```
## Compliance Report

When generating code, please adhere to the SOLID principles.
If you have to deviate, be sure to report the following after generation:

- Which principle was violated
- Why that deviation was necessary
- Suggestions for future refactoring or mitigation

If there was no deviation, clearly state “All SOLID principles are maintained.”

## Bug/Logic Review & Self‑Prompt

Review the generated code and the provided code, and point out “bugs that humans often write” and logical inconsistencies from the following perspectives. Always include a corresponding self‑prompt.

- Unintended off‑by‑one errors, confusing cumulative vs. differential values
- Unnecessary processing or wasteful computations
- Performance‑dangerous operations (e.g., enormous loops)
- Names or structures that are hard to read or misleading

If there’s nothing to point out, clearly state “There are no issues in the bug/logic review.”

## Refactoring Suggestions & Self‑Prompt

Review the provided code and the generated code, and if you have refactoring ideas, please provide them. Always include a corresponding self‑prompt.

If there are no refactoring suggestions, clearly state “There are no refactoring suggestions.”
```

Here’s the result after running the above prompt and the subsequent conversation.

### ChatGPT (GPT‑5)

Did it! It analyzed this zip (ConsoleApp4.zip) and extended it to count and display correctly from seconds → minutes → hours → days → months → years.  
Day counts are based on the Gregorian calendar, and leap years are correctly reflected (February switches between 29 and 28 days).

Download the updated project (ConsoleApp4\_year\_extended.zip)

___________

### Summary of Changes

*   Added new units:
    
    *   `HourUnit` (0–23)
        
    *   `DayUnit` (1–28/29/30/31: **variable depending on month and year**)
        
    *   `MonthUnit` (1–12)
        
    *   `YearUnit` (1–9999)
        
*   Unified display format: `YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:mm:ss`
    
*   Implemented **leap‑year** determination (400/100/4 rule)
    
*   Fixed the **minute unit carry bug** so that minutes increment hours
    
*   Minutes and seconds now join using `":ss"`, `":mm"`, hours join with a space, days and months join with `"-DD"`, `"-MM"`, and finally year prefixes everything.

### Excerpts of Added/Changed Files

```
ConsoleApp4/ConsoleApp4/0200_CalendarUnits/
  0210_SecondsUnit.cs           // Unified display and set initial values
  0220_MinutesUnit.cs           // Fixed carry bug + linked HourUnit
  0230_HourUnit.cs              // New (hours)
  0240_DayUnit.cs               // New (days, 1..31 variable)
  0250_MonthUnit.cs             // New (months, 1..12) — manages day count updates
  0260_YearUnit.cs              // New (years, 1..9999)
```

### Representative Code (New/Key Only)

```csharp
// MonthUnit: determines number of days based on year and updates DayUnit.End
private void UpdateDayEnd()
{
    int year = (NextUnit is YearUnit y) ? y.Value : 1;
    int month = (int)_value;
    int days = DaysInMonth(year, month);
    PrevUnit?.SetEnd(days);
}

private static bool IsLeapYear(int year)
{
    if (year % 400 == 0) return true;
    if (year % 100 == 0) return false;
    return year % 4 == 0;
}
```

```csharp
// MinuteUnit: fixed carry over to hours
public override void Increment()
{
    _value++;
    if (_value > End)
    {
        NextUnit?.Increment();
        _value = Start;
    }
}
```

> You can still use the existing `Program.cs` (just create `new SecondsUnit()` and it chains all the way up to years). Initial output example: `0001‑01‑01 00:00:00`

___________

### Compatibility & Design Notes

*   Implemented with minimal dependency on existing abstractions `CalendarUnitBase` / `INextUnit` / `IPrevUnit` (no breaking interface changes)
    
*   Management of **variable‑length days** is delegated to `MonthUnit → DayUnit.SetEnd()`
    
*   **Leap seconds** are not supported (judged out‑of‑scope)
    

___________

### Compliance Report (SOLID)

*   **Single Responsibility (S)**: Each unit is limited to the **addition and display of its own digit**
    
*   **Open/Closed (O)**: Added new units by extending existing abstractions with minimal modification (only changed `MinutesUnit` to fix carry and unify display)
    
*   **Liskov (L)**: All units follow the contract of `CalendarUnitBase` and are substitutable
    
*   **Interface Segregation (I)**: `INextUnit`/`IPrevUnit` granularity is appropriate as is
    
*   **Dependency Inversion (D)**: There is a **minor deviation**
    
    *   Deviation: `MonthUnit` casts `NextUnit` to `YearUnit` to get the year value
        
    *   Reason: The existing interfaces don’t have a contract for obtaining year information; to satisfy requirements (leap year support) without breaking interfaces, we took the minimal effort approach
        
    *   Future mitigation:
        
        1.  Introduce an `IYearInfo { int Year { get; } }`, implemented by `YearUnit`. Then `MonthUnit` depends on `NextUnit as IYearInfo`.
            
        2.  Alternatively, introduce an `ICalendarContext` and inject it into `MonthUnit` to provide external context like year or time zone
            

**Conclusion:** Except for the minor DIP deviation above, the other SOLID principles are maintained.

### Bug/Logic Review & Self‑Prompt

#### Issues

1.  **Missing carry from minutes to hours** (original `MinuteUnit`)
    
    *   Symptom: When `_value > 59` it sets `_value = 0` but doesn’t call `NextUnit?.Increment()`, so hours don’t increment
        
    *   Addressed: Already fixed (see code above)
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Is the carry into the next digit implemented consistently across all units? (When `_value > End` → call `NextUnit?.Increment(); _value = Start;`).”
        
2.  **Inconsistent display concatenation** (prefix decisions in `AsString()`)
    
    *   Symptom: Conditions like `NextUnit != null ? ":" : ""` differ by unit, making it hard to read
        
    *   Addressed: Unified by letting each unit be responsible only for its own prefix: minutes and seconds use `":"`, hours use a space, days and months use `"-"`, and the year has no prefix
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Does each unit decide its **own prefix** within its responsibility? Is the concatenation order uniquely Year→...→Second?”
        
3.  **The huge loop in `Program.cs`**
    
    *   Symptom: `RandomToAdd.Next(0, Int32.MaxValue)` increments can freeze the program or make it extremely slow
        
    *   Suggested fix: For demo purposes, limit it to something like `Next(0, 1000)`, or control the upper limit via command‑line arguments or environment variables
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Even in the worst case, will the demo code terminate in a realistic time? Can the number of iterations be controlled via arguments or settings?”
        
4.  **Name ambiguity (`SetEnd`)**
    
    *   Symptom: `IPrevUnit.SetEnd(long end)` means “the next unit sets the upper limit of the previous unit,” but the name alone doesn’t convey that clearly
        
    *   Proposed fix: Explain the intent in XML comments, or rename it to something like `SetMaxValueForRollover`
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Do method names and comments convey ownership/direction without misunderstanding?”
        
5.  **Inclusive boundary meaning (`End`)**
    
    *   Situation: `End` **includes** the upper limit (e.g., seconds go to 59)
        
    *   Fix: Clearly document that this is **inclusive**
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Is the boundary inclusive or exclusive? Is it unified across all units?”
        

**Other than the above, there are no major issues.**

___________

### Refactoring Suggestions & Self‑Prompt

1.  **Strict DIP (remove casts)**
    
    *   Suggestion: Introduce `IYearInfo { int Year { get; } }` and have `YearUnit` implement it. Then `MonthUnit` depends only on `NextUnit as IYearInfo`, eliminating concrete type dependency.
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Can upper‑level information (like year) be obtained via abstract interfaces? Can we avoid casting to specific types?”
        
2.  **Context injection**
    
    *   Suggestion: Introduce `ICalendarContext` that includes calendar info, locale, time zone, etc., and inject it. Then you can swap out variable specifications (leap seconds, Japanese era, etc.).
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Can we offload variable specifications into a context so that units are pure counters?”
        
3.  **Separate display policy**
    
    *   Suggestion: Introduce `ICalendarFormatter` (Strategy pattern) so that `AsString()` can be swapped without increasing derived classes (ISO 8601, locale‑specific, etc.).
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Is the string representation separated into a **strategy**, so that you can switch formatting without adding subclasses?”
        
4.  **Add tests**
    
    *   Suggestion: Provide boundary tests for month ends (28/29/30/31) and year ends (12/31 23:59:59 → 1/1 00:00:00) as well as leap years (e.g., 1900/2000/2004). This ensures regression coverage.
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Are there regression tests for boundary conditions and leap years?”
        
5.  **Improve naming**
    
    *   Suggestion: Rename `SetEnd` to `SetMaxValue` and add XML documentation to `PrevUnit`/`NextUnit`
        
    *   Self‑prompt:
        
        > “Does the API name/comment convey its intent at a glance?”
        

___________

### How to Use It (Still the Same)

```csharp
var seconds = new ConsoleApp4.CalendarUnits.SecondsUnit();

// Call Increment() a few times and it will carry from seconds to minutes to hours to … all the way to years
// 0001-01-01 00:00:00 → … → 0001-01-01 00:00:59 → 0001-01-01 00:01:00 → …
Console.WriteLine(seconds.AsString());
```

### cozyupk

I want to push the common logic in `Increment()` up to the base class.

### ChatGPT (GPT‑5)

Let’s do it. With the **Template Method** pattern we can pull “increment → boundary check → carry → post‑processing (updating dependent ranges/display notification)” **into the base class**, so that each unit only holds “range (Start/End), display, and (if necessary) overflow post‑processing,” and we can eliminate per‑unit `Increment()` implementations.

Here’s a minimal diff version of that proposal (it will work for all units from seconds through years).

___________

#### 1) Base Class (Common Increment)

```csharp
namespace ConsoleApp4.CalendarUnits
{
    public abstract class CalendarUnitBase : INextUnit, IPrevUnit
    {
        protected long _value;
        protected long _start;
        protected long _end; // inclusive

        public INextUnit? NextUnit { get; set; }
        public IPrevUnit? PrevUnit { get; set; }

        protected CalendarUnitBase(long start, long end)
        {
            _start = start;
            _end = end;
            _value = start;
        }

        public virtual void SetEnd(long endInclusive)
        {
            _end = endInclusive;
            if (_value > _end) _value = _end; // safety: clamp in variable ranges
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Common increment logic (delta ≥ 1). Range is [Start..End] inclusive.
        /// 1) Add value  2) If boundary is exceeded, carry over and reset to Start  3) Post‑overflow processing  4) Post‑value‑change processing
        /// </summary>
        public virtual void Increment(long delta = 1)
        {
            if (delta <= 0) return; // negative increments not supported here

            while (delta > 0)
            {
                long stepToBoundary = _end - _value;
                if (stepToBoundary >= delta)
                {
                    _value += delta;
                    OnValueChanged();
                    break;
                }

                // We will cross the boundary, so move to the boundary first then carry
                _value = _end;
                OnValueChanged(); // notify that we reached the boundary
                // Carry one step to the next unit
                NextUnit?.Increment(1);
                _value = _start;
                OnOverflowedToNext(); // post‑carry hook (e.g., update variable ranges)
                delta -= (stepToBoundary + 1);
            }
        }

        public long Start => _start;
        public long End => _end;
        public long Value => _value;

        /// <summary>Responsible for joining string representations (includes prefix)</summary>
        public abstract string AsString();

        /// <summary>Hook called right after carrying to the next unit (used for updating dependent ranges)</summary>
        protected virtual void OnOverflowedToNext() { }

        /// <summary>Hook called right after the value changes (override if side effects are needed)</summary>
        protected virtual void OnValueChanged() { }
    }
}
```

*   **Points:**
    
    *   `Increment(delta)` is **common across all units**.
        
    *   `OnOverflowedToNext()` is called immediately after the higher digit increments—useful for adjustments like updating day counts when the month changes.
        
    *   `OnValueChanged()` can be overridden if side effects are needed; leave it empty otherwise.
        
    *   With large `delta`, this is efficient: it moves to the boundary and carries in the minimum number of steps. Even with variable ranges (like days) it works by updating via `OnOverflowedToNext()`.
        

___________

#### 2) Each Unit (Examples)

**Seconds**

```csharp
internal sealed class SecondsUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public SecondsUnit() : base(0, 59)
    {
        NextUnit = new MinutesUnit { PrevUnit = this };
    }

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((MinutesUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}"; // ":" is the responsibility of minutes
}
```

**Minutes (changes: removed `Increment`; provides prefix)**

```csharp
internal sealed class MinutesUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public MinutesUnit() : base(0, 59)
    {
        NextUnit = new HoursUnit { PrevUnit = this };
    }

    internal string AsPrefix() => ":"; // responsibility for its prefix

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((HoursUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}";
}
```

**Hours**

```csharp
internal sealed class HoursUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public HoursUnit() : base(0, 23)
    {
        NextUnit = new DayUnit { PrevUnit = this };
    }

    internal string AsPrefix() => " ";

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((DayUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}";
}
```

**Days (maximum is provided from outside (month). It just uses common `Increment`.)**

```csharp
internal sealed class DayUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public DayUnit() : base(1, 31) { /* initial max is provisional; month adjusts via SetEnd */ }

    internal string AsPrefix() => "-";

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((MonthUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}";
}
```

**Month (commander of the variable range: updates day count in `OnValueChanged`/`OnOverflowedToNext`)**

```csharp
internal sealed class MonthUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public MonthUnit() : base(1, 12)
    {
        NextUnit = new YearUnit { PrevUnit = this };
    }

    internal string AsPrefix() => "-";

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((YearUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}";

    protected override void OnValueChanged()
        => UpdateDayEnd();

    protected override void OnOverflowedToNext()
        => UpdateDayEnd();

    private void UpdateDayEnd()
    {
        if (PrevUnit is DayUnit day && NextUnit is YearUnit y)
        {
            int days = DaysInMonth((int)y.Value, (int)_value);
            day.SetEnd(days);
        }
    }

    private static int DaysInMonth(int year, int month)
    {
        switch (month)
        {
            case 2: return IsLeapYear(year) ? 29 : 28;
            case 4:
            case 6:
            case 9:
            case 11: return 30;
            default: return 31;
        }
    }

    private static bool IsLeapYear(int year)
        => (year % 400 == 0) || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0);
}
```

**Years**

```csharp
internal sealed class YearUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public YearUnit() : base(1, 9999) { }

    internal string AsPrefix() => ""; // year is at the head

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{_value:0000}";
}
```

> The concatenation is completed through the `AsString()` chain `Year → Month → Day → Hour → Minute → Second`. For example: `"0001-01-01 00:00:00"`.

___________

#### 3) Usage (Unchanged)

```csharp
var seconds = new ConsoleApp4.CalendarUnits.SecondsUnit();
Console.WriteLine(seconds.AsString()); // 0001-01-01 00:00:00
seconds.Increment(59);
Console.WriteLine(seconds.AsString()); // 0001-01-01 00:00:59
seconds.Increment();                   // carry to minutes
Console.WriteLine(seconds.AsString()); // 0001-01-01 00:01:00
```

___________

#### 4) Why This Design?

*   Eliminates duplicate implementations of `Increment()` → closes a common bug source (forgotten carries)
    
*   **Variable ranges (days)** are handled by giving the responsibility of adjusting day limits to the **Month** while keeping the common logic intact
    
*   Provides two hooks:
    
    *   `OnValueChanged()`: called every time the unit’s value changes
        
    *   `OnOverflowedToNext()`: called immediately after carrying to the next unit  
        → improves readability and localizes side effects
        

___________

#### 5) Compliance Report (SOLID)

*   **S**: Each class is limited to “the range and display responsibility of its own digit”; `Increment()` is centralized in the base
    
*   **O**: You can add units by deriving classes; no need to change the existing base
    
*   **L**: All units comply with the `CalendarUnitBase` contract and are substitutable
    
*   **I**: `INextUnit`/`IPrevUnit` granularity is sufficient; no new interfaces needed with this change
    
*   **D**: A slight remaining DIP concern: Month→Year reference touches the concrete type (`YearUnit`)
    
    *   Reason: To access year information with minimal changes while preserving existing structure
        
    *   Mitigation: Introduce an `IYearInfo { int Year {get;} }` and replace with `NextUnit as IYearInfo`
        

> **Conclusion:** Except for the slight DIP concern above, **all SOLID principles are maintained.**

___________

#### 6) Bug/Logic Review & Self‑Prompt

*   **Off‑by‑one/carry omissions**
    
    *   Solved by centralizing the logic.
        
    *   **Self‑prompt:** “Are boundaries inclusive across the board, and do we correctly subtract `+1` when carrying?”
        
*   **Unnecessary/duplicate implementations**
    
    *   Removed per‑unit `Increment()`.
        
    *   **Self‑prompt:** “Are there any lingering overridden `Increment()` methods? Are the differences really necessary?”
        
*   **Performance (large loops)**
    
    *   With big `delta` this speeds up by grouping steps; even with variable ranges it correctly handles “move to boundary → carry.”
        
    *   **Self‑prompt:** “When `delta` is large, is the number of iterations proportional to the number of carries?”
        
*   **Naming/readability**
    
    *   Clarified hook names.
        
    *   **Self‑prompt:** “Should side effects go in `OnValueChanged` or `OnOverflowedToNext`?”
        

> **No other issues to point out.**

___________

#### 7) Additional Refactoring Proposals & Self‑Prompt

1.  **Strengthen DIP:** Introduce `IYearInfo`/`IMonthInfo` and have `MonthUnit` depend on abstractions.
    
    *   Self‑prompt: “What is the minimal interface needed to remove concrete type casts?”
        
2.  **Separate display policy:** Move the concatenation rules to an `ICalendarFormatter` (Strategy) so that you can switch formats without deriving new classes.
    
    *   Self‑prompt: “When you want to change the concatenation rules, can you switch without adding derived classes?”
        
3.  **Implement negative direction `Decrement()` symmetrically** (if needed).
    
    *   Self‑prompt: “When `delta < 0` is requested, can we write a symmetrical common logic?”
        

___________

Heading down this path places the entire `Increment()` in one base class; derived units can focus solely on business rules (updating variable ranges and display). If you want, I can also produce a version that fully implements `IYearInfo`.

### cozyupk

It feels odd that `Increment()` is `public` and `virtual`. I’d prefer to have `SecondsUnit` be the only one with a public implementation.

ChatGPT (GPT‑5)
---------------

I see! Indeed it’s unnatural that `public virtual Increment()` is exposed on `YearUnit` and `MonthUnit`—the only unit that should be callable from the outside is **the lowest unit (seconds)**; higher units should only be invoked internally.

___________

### Improvement Plan: `protected internal` + `sealed` + Template Separation

#### 1. Base Class

*   Make `IncrementCore()` `protected internal virtual`
    
*   Do not provide a public `Increment()` in the base class
    
*   Use it only from higher‑level classes
    

```csharp
public abstract class CalendarUnitBase : INextUnit, IPrevUnit
{
    protected long _value;
    protected long _start;
    protected long _end;

    public INextUnit? NextUnit { get; set; }
    public IPrevUnit? PrevUnit { get; set; }

    protected CalendarUnitBase(long start, long end)
    {
        _start = start;
        _end = end;
        _value = start;
    }

    public virtual void SetEnd(long endInclusive)
    {
        _end = endInclusive;
        if (_value > _end) _value = _end;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Increment logic for internal use only; from outside it is only called via SecondsUnit.
    /// </summary>
    protected internal virtual void IncrementCore(long delta = 1)
    {
        while (delta > 0)
        {
            long stepToBoundary = _end - _value;
            if (stepToBoundary >= delta)
            {
                _value += delta;
                OnValueChanged();
                break;
            }

            _value = _end;
            OnValueChanged();
            NextUnit?.IncrementCore(1); // internal call to carry to higher unit
            _value = _start;
            OnOverflowedToNext();
            delta -= (stepToBoundary + 1);
        }
    }

    public abstract string AsString();
    protected virtual void OnOverflowedToNext() { }
    protected virtual void OnValueChanged() { }
}
```

___________

#### 2. SecondsUnit

*   Provide `public void Increment()` as the **only external API**
    
*   Internally it calls `IncrementCore`
    

```csharp
internal sealed class SecondsUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public SecondsUnit() : base(0, 59)
    {
        NextUnit = new MinutesUnit { PrevUnit = this };
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// The only externally visible increment entry point
    /// </summary>
    public void Increment(long delta = 1) => IncrementCore(delta);

    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((MinutesUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}";
}
```

___________

#### 3. Higher Units (MinutesUnit, etc.)

*   Do **not** expose a public `Increment()`; only inherit `IncrementCore`
    
*   Derived classes can override as needed (e.g., `MonthUnit` updating day counts)
    

```csharp
internal sealed class MinutesUnit : CalendarUnitBase
{
    public MinutesUnit() : base(0, 59)
    {
        NextUnit = new HoursUnit { PrevUnit = this };
    }

    internal string AsPrefix() => ":";
    public override string AsString()
        => $"{((HoursUnit)NextUnit!).AsPrefix()}{_value:00}";
}
```

___________

### Benefits

*   **Simplified external API**
    
    *   Only `seconds.Increment()` is exposed
        
    *   Other units are internal‑only (`protected internal IncrementCore`)
        
*   **Prevent misuse**
    
    *   Developers can’t call `month.Increment()` or `year.Increment()` directly
        
*   **Preserve inheritance flexibility**
    
    *   `MonthUnit` can override `IncrementCore` to adjust the day count as needed
        

___________

### Self‑Prompt for Design Checks

*   “Are the externally callable methods limited to only what is truly necessary?”
    
*   “Do any units other than the lowest unit expose a public `Increment()`?”
    
*   “Are internal chaining calls going through `IncrementCore`, keeping responsibilities separated?”
    

___________

👉 I think it makes sense to summarize this direction as **exposing the public `Increment()` only on SecondsUnit**. How about updating the zip with this change?

Summary for Today

### GPT’s Summary

**When I tried following a flow of “humans design with OCP” → “AI fleshes it out,” the Hello‑World‑level extension actually worked.** In other words, in the generative‑AI era **OCP shines as a “survival strategy.”** That was the experimental result.

He talks about my survival strategy… well, whatever lol.
